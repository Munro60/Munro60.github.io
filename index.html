<h1> My First Project </h1> 
<h2><em>A little about me</em></h2>
<img src="Munro60.github.io/images/DSC_0264.JPG" width="200px" height="200px"/>
<p>            
My name is Harry Munro. I am a born and raised Australian and 
have lived here for about 15 years.I went to College in Brisbane, have half a business degree knocked
off and a diploma in Project Management.I am a big fan of computers, stock trading, music and movies.
I used to live in Papua New Guinea when I was younger,so I have a soft spot for the place and people
and hope to give something back to them if I get the chance!
</p>

<h2><em>Where did I get my interest in Information Technology?</em></h2>
<p>
I got my interest in I. T from when I was in primary school. It stemmed very strongly from playing early videogames when getting home from school,
 usually instead of doing homework! 
 But it eventually progressed into altering game files or “modding” games into altering the scripts of games (scripting).
 To make games more than they originally started as. 
 My current interest has moved from games-based Information tech into stock data and more business-related I.T skills.
 The likes of algorithmic trading and platforms for trades are my current keen interests, I hope to develop towards a sounder knowledge of their I.T components.
 </p>
 
 <h3><em>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</em></h3>
 <p>
I chose to come to RMIT for a few reasons. When I first enrolled, the travel bans between Australian states was still in effect.
There were no job opportunities in sight for myself and a lot of my friends, disappointingly.
So, with the rocky job market it seemed appropriate to return to my studies while I have the spare time.
RMIT had just gotten one of my friends an information tech degree as I was looking at Universities and he recommended it. 
</p>

<h3><em>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</em></h3>
<p>I am hoping to be able to gain the knowledge to setup a multi-user and multi-developer platform for a business model involving the stock market.
 It is more of an overall life goal to have the website up and perfect. But I am hoping this course will give me the groundwork to create and move towards the goal.
 My prior work is not consistent with the job that I want, but you have got to start somewhere!
 To work towards my goal ,It’s relatively straightforward;
 First, I’ll need to complete information tech and business (2-3 years total) ,then ill need to maintain part-time work (preferably somewhere with technological involved).
 Lastly, it may come to pass that its easier to work a few years somewhere to get my experience up .so I may have to assume a fifo (fly-in ,fly-out) and return to Papua New Guinea .
 It could also be fruitful to take up another course if more qualifications are needed .Or even taking my diploma to the highest grade.
 </p>
 <h3><em>What could be a potential ‘ideal’ job?</em></h3>
 <img src="Munro60.github.io/images/Job.png" width="350px" height="350px"/>
 <p>
The job itself is for a high-end web development and analytics company called ‘Chromatix’. They are seeking someone to aid in the specifics of technical analytics.
Which is essentially looking into business’ and their models to see where we can produce better running API’s, interfaces or the architecture of their web designs.
I find it appealing because not many people in the market have the skills to do the job, so market saturation is not too high. And if you do a good job, you’ll get nothing but opportunities .
I will need to have completed my business studies and my Information Technology studies to be able to secure even an interview with the company .
My current skillset pales in comparison to the jobs requirements but I have already proceeded down the path of becoming what they require .
Especially with business and project management as a background I hope I can maintain the course and grow my skillset to suit the role.

<h3><em> What does my personality Profile look like?</em></h3>
<img src="Munro60.github.io/images/CreativityTest.png" width="350px" height="350px"/>
<p>The test results attained from this examination were a bit jarring, honestly. I had thought myself a little bolder and with a greater perspective than the margin I got.
 It leads me more to contend the results rather than take them as gospel.
Although, if the results are accurate and I just do not see them, perhaps it will be useful in a 
team-oriented environment where my persistence can go hand in hand with another’s boldness or complexity.
After all, that is what teams are for. So, I think I will need to work towards finding a group with dissimilar 
traits than my own, or more complementary traits to change the balance to a more typically productive cohesion.
</p>
 <h3><em> What about learning style?</em></h3>
 <img src="Munro60.github.io/images/LearningStyle.png" width="350px" height="350px"/>
 <p>This test I found interesting as it shows a little insight into something I have not thought about before.
I got out of the learning style analysis that I need more visual aids rather than just reading and taking notes,
I need to work towards more expressive means to spark my brain. Perhaps in a group I will need to maintain a methodology
of learning that is consistent with watching and listening until I understand the ideas. Then be able to convey the lessons to the group if they need help.
I will also probably need to let them know that I am a little slower on the uptake unless it is a visual medium.
 </p>
 <h3><em> What about Myers-Briggs?</em></h3>
 <img src="Munro60.github.io/images/MyersBriggs.png" width="500px" height="500px"/>
 <p>The Myers-Briggs test seemed relatively accurate compared to the prior two tests .As well as specifics on the gradient to which you lean ,it grades your answers in a confidence inspiring way .
 I can agree with the results of this test and I believe it means that I’ll be able to make confident assumptions within the confines of my teamwork .
 I also hope to be able to help with the approaches to decision making and letting the team decide if the methods are sound .
 I hope to form a team that complements the other ends of the gradient for each characteristic .So whereas I lean more toward 'prospecting' or finding decision pathways ,i hope to find a team member on the judging of the pathway.
 So that we might find a harmonious balance and boost productivity .

 <h2><strong> My Future Project Idea!</strong>
 
 <h3><em>Introduction</em></h3>
 <p>The project in mind has lots of financial and technological requirements to function as intended .
But, if done correctly I believe it could be a boon to the Fintech and trade sectors of the financial markets .
There is a niche for many technology boosted financial aides and tools that has been capitalized on by many huge
companies and banking conglomerates ranging from Westpac investing and Commsec (Commonwealth bank) all the way to international market watchers and tool providers such as Bloomberg.
My project hopes to unify the past historical data of not just companies, firms and agencies, but also individual businesspeople.
I hope to be able to develop a platform for comparing successful businesspeople movements from company to company and how the moves affected the environments they moved into.
To in theory be able to track the movements of positive return individuals, to hypothesis potential investment increases. But with simple presentation of a user interface
to make it easy to follow for people who don’t understand the background complexities of the numerical data. 
</p>

<h3><em>Why do I want to do this?</em></h3>
<p>
Well , when I first started day trading as a hobby , the complexities of all the terminology and numerical data seemed very off putting when you’re looking at vast
spreadsheets of data that could either be telling you its going to be a successful sure-thing or a near impossible financial recovery .That is part of the gamble that
is stock trading .However ,there are many tools and services available that have been developed by firms and banks to make trading more approachable or simplified to newcomers .
Most are quite expensive , charging subscription fees or taking commission off trades to make a profit. But with a simplified tool like I suggest that tracks the successful people 
and their trading patterns instead of a blindingly large market to analyze. I hope to simplify trading. That is why I want to do this.
 </p>
 <h3><em>How will it work?</em></h3>
 <p>
 Originally it will start out as a simply functioning web service. One that can look up past historical data for companies by going through past companies’ performance data that is freely available.
 While there are many tools out there to do this already, this will just be a baby step into understanding the problems and solutions that may be encountered in the future. Whilst figuring the historical
 data side out, it will also in future note the people who sit in the highest positions in the company e.g Chief Technical Officer (CTO) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Chief Financial Officer (CFO) 
 and mark them alongside the dates of the prior performance data. Thus, users can see the effects the leaders’ strategies and leadership styles had on the performance of the companies whilst they were at
 the forefront of operations.
 
 After enough data is collected to make adequate ratings of executives performance ,it should be easier to correlate which of them are boons to companies and which ones are hinderances .
 Then my service should be able to provide a decent recommendation on companies or firms to invest in ,based on the data gathered .Although I hope to add the more traditional features to the 
 service further down the line to attract people who have the knowledge to read raw financial data .The revenue to keep the overheads down would be gathered through a balanced amount of 
 advertisement ,but majority through a low-cost subscription based business model. However complicated the background data workings are, I hope to maintain a smooth and clean user interface 
 for ease of use. And to attract people from novice level traders to experienced traders.
 </p>
 <h3><em>What tools and technology will I use?</em></h3>
 <p>
 For the quantitative data I’ll need the use of either a paid data extraction service such as “Scrapinghub” or “Ephesoft” to peruse the documentation in bulk to extract the necessary data to add to comparison matrixes .
 The other alternative is to pay a data analyst to manually peruse data and turn it into concise and readable spreadsheets .Although as a new idea/new startup ,it would be far cheaper an option to pay a monthly subscription
 fee for an already made ,purpose-built software that is designed to be used for these sorts of problems. The website itself will be as simple as possible, aesthetically clean.
 It will be coded using HTML preferably, although after optimization and needs change, so might the web design tools. GitHub for beginning testing might also be a necessity.
 </p>
 <h3><em>What skills will I need?</em></h3>
 <p>
 The skills needed to create the website itself will no doubt include HTML proficiency, potentially CSS too depending on how/what the service grows into with added features. No hardware will be required except a computer/s to write the base HTML/CSS on.
 It should be quite simple to learn the skills, albeit time consuming. Coding the actual website might be a more difficult matter entirely, potentially taking months to refine. And the cost for using the data scraping utilities will add to the difficulty. 
 Depending on which service /payment plan is chosen.
 </p>
 <h3><em>What is the desired outcome?</em></h3>
 <p>
 If the project is successful and the goals and aims are achieved, then it should provide yet another resource for contrasting valuable data to simplify decision making for traders of all experience levels.
 If it takes becomes more successful than originally intended, then it could potentially branch of and grow into many combined services that are complicated under the surface but follow the simple and easy 
 to use aesthetic nature of the original idea. Which will hopefully just provide more helpful utilities to all experience levels of traders.
