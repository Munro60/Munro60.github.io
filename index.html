<h1> My First Project </h1> 
<h2><em>A little about me</em></h2>
<img src="Munro60.github.io/images/DSC_0264.JPG" width="200px" height="200px"/>
<p>            
My name is Harry Munro. I am a born and raised Australian and 
have lived here for about 15 years.I went to College in Brisbane, have half a business degree knocked
off and a diploma in Project Management.I am a big fan of computers, stock trading, music and movies.
I used to live in Papua New Guinea when I was younger,so I have a soft spot for the place and people
and hope to give something back to them if I get the chance!
</p>

<h2><em>Where did I get my interest in Information Technology?</em></h2>
<p>
I got my interest in I. T from when I was in primary school. It stemmed very strongly from playing early videogames when getting home from school,
 usually instead of doing homework! 
 But it eventually progressed into altering game files or “modding” games into altering the scripts of games (scripting).
 To make games more than they originally started as. 
 My current interest has moved from games-based Information tech into stock data and more business-related I.T skills.
 The likes of algorithmic trading and platforms for trades are my current keen interests, I hope to develop towards a sounder knowledge of their I.T components.
 </p>
 
 <h3><em>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</em></h3>
 <p>
 I chose to come to RMIT for a few reasons. When I first enrolled, the travel bans between Australian states was still in effect, and there were disappointingly
  no job opportunities in sight for myself and a lot of my friends. So this rocky environment seemed an appropriate time to return to my studies.
  A close friend had just received an IT degree from RMIT so once he recommended it, I was sold!
</p>

<h3><em>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</em></h3>
<p>
 I am hoping to be able to gain the knowledge to setup a multi-user and multi-developer platform for a business model involving the stock market.
 It is more of an overall life goal to have the website up and perfect. But I am hoping this course will give me the groundwork to create and move towards the goal.
 My prior work is not consistent with the job that I want, but you have got to start somewhere!
 To work towards my goal ,It’s relatively straightforward;
 First, I’ll need to complete information tech and business (2-3 years total) ,then ill need to maintain part-time work (preferably somewhere with technological involved).
 Lastly, it may come to pass that its easier to work a few years somewhere to get my experience up .so I may have to assume a fifo (fly-in ,fly-out) and return to Papua New Guinea .
 It could also be fruitful to take up another course if more qualifications are needed .Or even taking my diploma to the highest grade.
 </p>
 <h3><em>What could be a potential ‘ideal’ job?</em></h3>
 <img src="Munro60.github.io/images/Job.png" width="350px" height="350px"/>
 <p>
The job itself is for a high-end web development and analytics company called ‘Chromatix’. They are seeking someone to aid in the specifics of technical analytics.
Which is essentially looking into business’ and their models to see where we can produce better running API’s, interfaces or the architecture of their web designs.
I find it appealing because not many people in the market have the skills to do the job, so market saturation is not too high. And if you do a good job, you’ll get nothing but opportunities .
I will need to have completed my business studies and my Information Technology studies to be able to secure even an interview with the company .
My current skillset pales in comparison to the jobs requirements but I have already proceeded down the path of becoming what they require .
Especially with business and project management as a background I hope I can maintain the course and grow my skillset to suit the role.

<h3><em> What does my personality Profile look like?</em></h3>
<img src="Munro60.github.io/images/CreativityTest.png" width="350px" height="350px"/>
<p>
The test results attained from this examination were honestly a bit jarring. I think of myself as someone who is bolder and with greater perspective.
Due to this I don’t believe these results are 100% accurate. However, perhaps the results are accurate and I do not see myself in this way, and if so this will be a 
useful result to refer to in a team-oriented environment where my persistence can go hand in hand with another’s boldness or complexity. After all, that is what teams
are for. So, I think I will need to work towards finding a group with dissimilar traits than my own, or more complementary traits to change the balance to a more typically 
productive cohesion.
</p>
<h3><em> What about learning style?</em></h3>

 <h3><em> What about Myers-Briggs?</em></h3>
 <img src="Munro60.github.io/images/MyersBriggs.png" width="500px" height="500px"/>
 <p>The Myers-Briggs test seemed relatively accurate compared to the prior two tests .As well as specifics on the gradient to which you lean ,it grades your answers in a confidence inspiring way .
 I can agree with the results of this test and I believe it means that I’ll be able to make confident assumptions within the confines of my teamwork .
 I also hope to be able to help with the approaches to decision making and letting the team decide if the methods are sound .
 I hope to form a team that complements the other ends of the gradient for each characteristic .So whereas I lean more toward 'prospecting' or finding decision pathways ,i hope to find a team member on the judging of the pathway.
 So that we might find a harmonious balance and boost productivity .

 <h2><strong> My Future Project Idea!</strong>
 
 <h3><em>Introduction</em></h3>
 <p>
  The project in mind has lots of financial and technological requirements to function as intended and so will be complex. However, if done correctly I believe it could be
  a boon to the financial technology and trade sectors of the financial markets. There is a niche for many technology-boosted financial aides and tools that has been 
  capitalized on by many large companies and banking conglomerates, ranging from Westpac Investing and the Commonwealth Bank’s CommSec, all the way to international market 
  watchers and tool providers such as Bloomberg. My project hopes to unify the past historical data of not just companies, firms and agencies, but also individual businesspeople.
  I hope to be able to develop a platform that compares successful businesspeople’s movements from company to company, and how the moves affected the environments they moved into.
  Theoretically this will then track the movements of positive return individuals and hypothesise potential investment increases. The presentation would be of utmost importance, with a simple user 
  interface making it easy for those without a financial or IT background to understand the data even if they may not understand the background complexities of the program. 
</p>

<h3><em>Why do I want to do this?</em></h3>
<p>
When I began day trading as a hobby, the complexities of the terminology and numerical data seemed very off-putting. The vast spreadsheets of data that are readily available could either
 be telling you it’s going to be a successful investment, or a near impossible financial recovery. That is part of the gamble that is stock trading. However, there are many tools and services 
 that have been developed to make trading more approachable or simplified to newcomers. Most are quite expensive, and derive an income from subscription fees or commissions on trades. However, 
 the simplified tool I want to design will simplify trading. By tracking ‘successful’ people (such as investors, firms, banks) and their trading patterns I hope to provide a clearer insight into the market
 for those who find the data presently available off-putting and exclusionary.
 </p>
 <h3><em>How will it work?</em></h3>
 <p>
 Originally it will start out as a simply functioning web service. One that can look up past historical data for companies by going through past companies’ performance data that is freely available.
 While there are many tools out there to do this already, this will just be a baby step into understanding the problems and solutions that may be encountered in the future. Whilst figuring the historical
 data side out, it will also in future note the people who sit in the highest positions in the company e.g Chief Technical Officer (CTO) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Chief Financial Officer (CFO) 
 and mark them alongside the dates of the prior performance data. Thus, users can see the effects the leaders’ strategies and leadership styles had on the performance of the companies whilst they were at
 the forefront of operations.
 
After sufficient data has been collected to make adequate ratings of executives’ performance, it should be easier to correlate which of them are advantages to their companies, and which are hinderances.
From here I hope my service will be able to provide a data-based recommendation on which companies or firms to invest in. I also hope to add more traditional features to the service further down the line to 
 attract those who have the knowledge to read raw financial data, thus making it a tool for the layman and the advanced investor. The revenue would be gathered mainly through a low-cost subscription based business model, 
 and also through a balanced amount of advertisement. The goal would be to keep overhead costs as low as possible whilst in the development phase. As complicated as the background data workings are, I hope to maintain a smooth
 and clean user interface for ease of use, in order to attract traders ranging from novice to experienced. 
 </p>
 <h3><em>What tools and technology will I use?</em></h3>
 <p>
 For the quantitative data I’ll need the use of either a paid data extraction service such as ‘Scrapinghub’ or ‘Ephesoft’ to peruse the bulk documentation available and extract the necessary data to add to comparison matrixes.
 The other alternative is to pay a data analyst to manually peruse data and turn it into concise and readable spreadsheets, however this would be a time-consuming process. As a startup, it would be a cheaper and more time-effective 
 option to utilise a monthly subscription fee for an already made, purpose-built software such as ‘Ephesoft’. The website itself will be as simple as possible and aesthetically clean. It will preferably be coded using HTML however once optimization 
 and needs change, so might the web design tools. GitHub for beginning testing might also be a necessity.
 </p>
 <h3><em>What skills will I need?</em></h3>
 <p>
 The skills needed to create the website itself will no doubt include HTML proficiency, potentially CSS too depending on how/what the service grows into with added features. No hardware will be required except a computer/s to write the base HTML/CSS on.
 It should be quite simple to learn the skills, albeit time consuming. Coding the actual website might be a more difficult matter entirely, potentially taking months to refine. And the cost for using the data scraping utilities will add to the difficulty. 
 Depending on which service /payment plan is chosen.
 </p>
 <h3><em>What is the desired outcome?</em></h3>
 <p>
 If the project is successful and the goals and aims are achieved, then it should provide yet another resource for contrasting valuable data to simplify decision making for traders of all experience levels.
 If it takes becomes more successful than originally intended, then it could potentially branch of and grow into many combined services that are complicated under the surface but follow the simple and easy 
 to use aesthetic nature of the original idea. Which will hopefully just provide more helpful utilities to all experience levels of traders.
